## pastrami

[pəˈstrɑmi]

Pastrami is a Romanian dish usually made from beef brisket, and sometimes from lamb, or turkey. The raw meat is brined, partially dried, seasoned with herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed. Like corned beef, pastrami was originally created as a way to preserve meat before the invention of refrigeration. One of the iconic meats of American Jewish cuisine and New York City cuisine, hot pastrami is typically served at delicatessens on sandwiches such as the pastrami on rye.
