[What makes a cognitive super-ager?](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-aging/what-does-it-take-to-be-a-super-ager)
\
Dr. Bradford Dickerson, a neurologist at Harvard-affiliated 
Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues have been studying 
super-agers for several years. Their results suggest that embracing 
new mental challenges may be the key to preserving both brain tissue 
and brain function.

In one study, 81 healthy adults — 40 of whom were 60 to 80 years old 
and 41 of whom were 18 to 35 — were read a list of 16 nouns six times. 
Twenty minutes later, they were asked to recall as many of the words 
as possible. While 23 of the older participants recalled nine or 
fewer words, a score considered average for their age group, 17 
seniors — the super-agers — could remember 14 words or more, a score 
similar to that of the younger participants.
