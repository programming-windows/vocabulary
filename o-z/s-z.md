## Tag, you're it

When little children are at school they play a game called "tig". Or "tag".

One person is "it" and all the other children try to keep away from them.

They will run around the field keeping away from the person who is "it" until finally the "it" person manages to touch one of them.

When he does he will say "Tig! You're it!"

And then the new "it" Will have to run around and try to touch one of the kids.

Extra Rule - **No Tag Backs**\
Sometimes the "it" will finally manage to "tag" a second kid after many exhausting minutes of chasing the whole class around, and that second kid will immediately tag them back and run away again.

How frustrating.

To stop this, the "no tag backs" rule was invented.

I play with the original rules though. Tag backs are just fine. :)
